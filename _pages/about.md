I'm a final year graduate student at BTU, studying Cyber Security program. My research interests are in traffic analysis in Tor network, Attack analysis in Federated Learning, and bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning! I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia. Look at the [Fun stuff](https://hoseinpur.github.io/fun/) for the fun part!

# Selected Experiences 


## Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the "Trace Oddity: Methodologies for Data-Driven Traffic Analysis on Tor" paper and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments. To accompany this work, I will submit a blog post. currently I am working on similar papers.
