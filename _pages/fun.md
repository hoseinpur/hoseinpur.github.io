This is me trying to catch up on things in my first year of stay in Germany! I'm so happy that I have many photos to look
back and remember where and when I started, Because that is a starter to explain where I am now! In a nutshell, I'm doing 
just fine now but that's not enough. So to do great, here are the things that boost my mood and help me to achieve my best!

## Playing Chess

Now this is somethig that keeps me awake at nights, it is stronger than my coffee and still is challenging for me but I 
do enjoy it so much! I'm a member of World Chess Club Berlin and it's my go-to place/bar during the days that I'm an extrovert! 
IYKYK, there is always new strategies to learn or practice the ones you already know and it's not enough! So, if you never tried 
it either don't or if you do, keep this in mind that once you begin there's no going back! You're welcome.

My goal: have a proper Blitz ranking this year so that I can share it here.

## Coffee but aesthetically pleasing
Now, y'll remember pandemic days right?! During quarantine that we all were stuck at home, I did a thing! Depression 
was hitting so hard and I had to make a decision! Yes, the only way to get out of all those drama was to spend money! yes we 
all became materialist during that time, I was also no exception! I decided to order a semi-professional espresso machine and start
to learn how to make a proper coffee!! and I succeed! Not only that I can make freshly brewed coffee, but I also can pour different
latte art designs! I learned all the skills related to coffee-making and now I can officially call myself a Home-Barista! 

My goal: participating in barista/latte art competitions this year in Germany.
