This is me trying to catch up on things in my first year of stay in Germany! I'm so happy that I have many photos to look
back and remember where and when I started, Because that is a starter to explain where I am now! In a nutshell, I'm doing 
just fine now but that's not enough. So to do great, here are the things that boost my mood and help me to achieve my best!

## Playing Chess

Now this is somethig that keeps me awake at nights, it is stronger than my coffee and still is challenging for me but I 
do enjoy it so much! I'm a member of World Chess Club Berlin and it's my go-to place/bar during the days that I'm an extrovert! 
IYKYK, there is always new strategies to learn or practice the ones you know and it's not enough! So, if you never tried 
it either don't or if you do, keep this in mind that once you begin there's no going back! You're welcome.
