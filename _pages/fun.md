This is me trying to catch up on thing in my first year of stay in Germany! I'm so happy that I have many photos to look
back and remember where and when I started, Because that is a starter to explain where I am now! In a nutshell, I'm doing 
just fine but that's not enough, so to do great here are the things that boost my mood and help me to achieve my best!
